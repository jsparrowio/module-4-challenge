UofM/edX Coding Bootcamp - Challenge 4

## Description

This was the fourth challenge we will complete for the UofM/edX Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp. It was completed to practice our skills with more intermediate JavaScript concepts such as form event listeners, click events, event propagation, preventing default, and storing to localStorage. It also helped us practice our skills with functions, variables, and loops as we had to write all of them from scratch (only provided info was the name of the functions).  The actual produced product was a personal blog that takes input from a form and stores the data in local storage.

## Usage

No actual intended usage, primary reason for development was to meet the criteria of the challenge. Can be used as a locally stored personal blog.
